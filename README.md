# Snake
   A remake of the classic retro game, snake which forces the user to control the snake using your "WASD" keys, to eat food and score points. This is a bare bones creation of the classic game snake, and I plan on developing the game further. You will notice commented out sections in the JavaScript code, specifically variables/ functions titled "Penalty" or "Matrix", which will either slow down the framerate, or increase it.

# What I Learned
